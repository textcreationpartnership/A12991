            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Hauing therfore the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a good conſcienc,e that herein is nothing auouched, which may not well by the word be warranted, I haue thoughte good to ſet downe the whole, and the rather, for that bothe the ſeconde and thirde partes, as well as the firſte

Wheras without the feare of the Lorde, there is no wiſedome, neyther is it poſſible for youth to go well forwarde in vertue and good manners, things as neceſſarie as learning, whiche, without theſe, is but a ring of gold in a ſwines ſnoute, if they bée not trained vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. For moſt true is that in déede golden ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Wherewithall ſhal a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redreſſe his way? in taking heed thereto according to thy worde.</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hearken all you that be Scholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there is no other meanes to haue your youth to profite in vertue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, but by taking héede to the worde
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6983:51"/> of the Lorde. And what parent is he that ſetteth hys ſonne to ſchoole, but that hée woulde haue him as well godly as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? as well a vertuous childe, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſcholler? as well inſtructed vnto ſaluation, as furthered in prophane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? For if there be any that haue other endes in putting their children to ſchole, theſe being contemned, your ſchooles wer better to be without them, than combred wyth them. From whence come the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall complaintes of the vngraciouſneſſe and vnhappineſſe of ſchollers, but from this, that you neuer teache them theyr dueties out of the booke of the Lorde. Some of you, thinke ouer muche gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be the way, and others continual and tyrannicall ſcourgyng and whyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng to be the way, whereas in déed you are both ſortes far and wide out of the waye. For the one with too much leuitie encourageth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a leud licenciouſneſſe and looſeneſſe of maners: the others thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by cruell and butcherly beatyng to wynne reformation, ingender in them ſuch a miſlike and lothyng of learning,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6983:52"/> that they abhorre with as deadly hatred the ſchoole houſe, as we doe thoſe things whiche are moſte lothſome and noyſome vnto vs. I like wel of gentleneſſe, if it be ſuch as by it manners be not corrupted &amp; ſpilled, and on the other ſide I allowe of reaſonable correction, ſo as it be vſed as the laſte remedie, that is, when no other wyll ſerue. But the firſt, the beſt and the chiefeſt way, is to begin with teaching your youth the feare of the Lorde: For that is, as Salomon ſayth, the beginning of Wiſdome. But you feare peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it ſhoulde be to little profite to ſpeake vnto children of religion: I heare you, and thinke of that you ſaye, as a cloake to hyde your faulte, and couer for your ſlouthfulneſſe, rather than a true cauſe to ſtaye this duetie. He that hathe ſayd, <hi>ſuffer little children to come vnto me and forbidde them not, for vnto ſuch belongeth the kingdome of heauen,</hi> wyl no doubte, bleſſe your labours taken in hande in his feare. Beginne therefore at length and trye: you ſhal I warrant you, to your comfort, ſée your youth profite in

For can it poſſibly be otherwiſe, that themſelues Papiſtes, and vnder Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes hauing the gouernement of youth, as men choſen for the purpoſe, ſhoulde teach any other than Papiſtrie.

So for

               <p n="2">2 Secondly, for aſmuche as it is here ſaide, that Cornelius his prayers and almes déedes were accepted before God, it muſte néedes followe, that Cornelius had faith. For whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne. And without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God. It were blaſphemy to affirme, that GOD is delighted with ſin, but God is delighted with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and almes of Cornelius: if therefore they were not ſinne, then were they done in faith, and therefore Cornelius hadde nowe alreadie faith. God is ſaide to bée
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6983:90"/> wel pleaſed with them, it followeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inuincibly, that they procéeded of Faith.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6983:90"/> but that Cornelius his faith hadde ſome grounde on him, albeit not in ſuche ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as it pleaſed God afterwarde to reueale vnto him. Wherefore lette the Papiſts lay their hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mouth,<note place="margin">Againſte the Papiſts abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing this place.</note> whiche abuſe this place ſhamefully twoo wayes, the one, to proue, that before Faith, a manne maye doe good works, whyche maye ſerue as preparatiues vnto Faith: and ſecondlye, that oure workes doe deſerue at the handes of GOD, encreaſe of hys good giftes and graces in vs, according vnto the ſeuerall merites of euerye one of vs. For the fleſhlye manne is ſo farre off from preparing himſelfe of hys owne power, to winne the grace of GOD,<note place="margin">1.

And as for deſeruing, the Scripture playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye teacheth, that Faith it ſelfe, from whence all other good workes do ſpring, is the onely gifte of GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſte Workes, the fruites of the ſame, be ſo likewiſe. Wherefore if we

Yet when they haue prated for their merits, vntill their tongues ake, and cried out for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings, till their throates be hoarſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they bring nothing that maye ſtir vp a man to doe well, but leaue vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in doubte whether oure workes pleaſe God or no: nay they flatly affirme that it is highe arrogancie, and greate preſumption, for a man to aſſure himſelf of ſaluation, whereas we denying, that oure workes can deſerue any thing, and yet teaching, that there is a rewarde laide vp for them of mercie, which faith taketh hold on in Chriſt, do by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſtirre vppe and pricke forwarde the godly to good works, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they knowe they ſhall not loſe their laboure, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence whereof (albeit it pleaſe the Lorde in many places of the Scripture, to terme by the name of a Rewarde, yet hereof cannot be concluded deſerte, but it is rather a ſpeciall token of Gods greate fatherlye loue, that thus crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <p>So, when our firſt Parentes Adam &amp; Eue had hidden themſelues for ſhame of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6983:93"/> their tranſgreſſion among the trées of the garden, GOD ſéeketh and findeth them oute, and aſſureth them of comfort in the promiſed ſéede. So he calleth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham out of Vr of the Chaldeis, when he wallowed in Idolatrie. Lot he dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth (as it were) violently, and againſt hys will, out of the deſtruction of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

               <p n="2">2 Secondlye, in that GOD inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth not Cornelius by himſelfe, nor by the Angell, whiche bothe he coulde haue done, but appointeth hym ouer vnto Peter, as before hée dyd Paule vnto Ananias.

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:6983:94"/>3 Thirdly, as this place commendeth the dignitie of the preching of the word, ſo alſo, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell reporteth of Peter vnto Cornelius, that he ſhold teach him what to doe, it alſo inſtructeth vs what maner of perſon he ought to be, which is to be admitted into this high &amp; honorable function of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie, namely, ſuche a one, as can tel Cornelius what to do for to attaine vnto ſaluation, that is, ſuche a one, as is able to teach them of his cure &amp; charge their dueties vnto the Lord: for Paule vnto Titus,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9.</note> willeth that he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is a Miniſter, be ſuche a one as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful word according vnto doctrine, maye be able to exhorte with wholſome doctrine, &amp; to improue thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpeak againſt it.

The Lorde graunte vnto thoſe, whome it concerneth to redreſſe this foule abuſe, bowels of pitie and compaſſion, with our Sauioure Chriſte to yearne at the greate ignoraunce of the people in the Countrie, for lacke of able teachers: in ſomuche, that in ſome Pariſhes it were no hard matter to finde many, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

               <p n="4">4 Fourthlye, where it is ſayde that Cornelius ſhould heare of Peter at Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa at the houſe of one Simon a Tanner,

But God hath hadde at all times, and in all places, and hath at this time, and in this land, many of the greate men, that make accountes of Peter, and the Lord multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye them continuallye for his Chriſtes ſake, and graunt that they maye all haue God his faithfull and paineful miniſters and preachers in a reuerent regarde and good accounte.

And he that commaunded by the worde of God

Al theſe preferred their owne wiſedome, pollicie, and carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before the wiſdome, and expreſſe preceptes of the Lorde, and the fruites that thereof they reaped, were their own deſtruction.

For before our GOD, obedience is far better, and of greater accountes than ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond leſſon of this thirde parte is,<note place="margin">What fruite Cornelius reaped by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertuous bringing vp of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde.</note> the fruit that Cornelius reaped by his godly inſtructing of his familie, namelye therby he hath gained thus much, that he hath nowe faithful and truſtie ſeruaunts whome he maye ſende on his errande in this graue &amp; weyghtie matter, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſaluation of him and his. All you that be maſters, learne out of this, to be careful to plant in your ſeruaunts the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6983:99"/> feare of the Lord, and then ſhal you finde them faythfull vnto you, as Abraham had his ſeruaunt, as we reade in the 24. of Geneſis. And thoſe, that forſlewe this duetie, it is no marueyle, if bycauſe they will not yéeld vnto God their duetie, they finde their owne ſeruauntes faithleſſe and truſteleſſe, lyars, filchers, ſtealers, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, diſobedient, blaſphemers, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and altogither giuen ouer to al ſin &amp; vngodlyneſſe.

                  <note place="margin">Religiouſnes in ſouldiers.</note>The laſte note of thys thyrde point, and of this whole ſcripture, is, that with two of his ſeruantes, Cornelius ſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſouldiour that waited vpon him, who feared GOD. Where we learne, that no trade nor profeſſion of life is to bée preuiledged from the ſeruice of GOD, ſith that ſouldiours, who the further they are from it, the more hardie of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number they are accounted, haue in

For with their mouthes they make ieſts, and their heart goeth after their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe? And lo, thou art vnto them as a ieſting ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voyce, and can ſing well. For they heare thy wordes but do them not.
